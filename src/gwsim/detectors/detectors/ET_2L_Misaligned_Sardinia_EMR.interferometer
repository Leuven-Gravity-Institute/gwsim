; The detector arms are defined on the tangent plane at the vertex position.
; The arm 1 of E1 has the same azimuth angle (0.33916285632 rad) and altitude (0.0 rad) of the Virgo arm 1 in the local horizontal coordinate system center at the E1 vertex.
; Both vertices have the same height of the Virgo V1 vertex (51.88399887084961 m).
; Each detector is oriented w.r.t. its local North. The misaligned configuration corresponds to a relative angle of 45◦, from COBA paper.
