==================
Reading data files
==================

This guide provides basic explanations and examples of how to open and read data files generated with GWSim.

It uses the `GWpy <https://gwpy.github.io/>`_ Python package.
For more details, refer to the GWpy documentation.

-------------------
Reading frame file
-------------------

GWSim generate data in GWF (frame file) format.
To read data from a frame file, specify the file path and the name of the channel to be read:

.. code-block:: python

    from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

    data = TimeSeries.read("filename.gwf", channel)

-------------------
Merging frame files
-------------------

Frame files generated by GWSim may contain different types of content (noise, signals, glitches, …).
To obtain a realistic data stream, you may need to read multiple files and combine them, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

    # Read frame files for noise and BBH data
    noise_data = TimeSeries.read("filename_noise.gwf", channel_noise)
    bbh_data = TimeSeries.read("filename_bbh.gwf", channel_bbh)

    # Add them together
    data = noise_data.inject(bbh_data)

.. note::

    Two time series can be added together only if their time properties (start time, sampling frequency, duration) coincide.

    Two time series with different units cannot be added together.
    If necessary, override the units before combining them:

    .. code-block:: python

        from astropy.units import Unit

        noise_data.override_unit(Unit())
        bbh_data.override_unit(Unit())
