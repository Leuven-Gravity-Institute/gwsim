==================
Generating ET data
==================

This guide shows how to use GWSim to create one day of mock data for the Einstein Telescope (ET), including realistic gravitational-wave signals and detector noise.

We use the ET triangular configuration located in the Meuse-Rhine Euregion as an example.
For other detector configurations or ready-to-use example configuration files, see ```SECTION X```.

The data will be saved in GWF (frame file) format with a sampling frequency of 4096 Hz.
These files can be read and manipulated with the `gwpy <https://gwpy.github.io/>`_ package (see ``SECTION Y``).

-------------------------
Generating detector noise
-------------------------

Detector noise can be generated using configuration files located in :code:`gwsim/examples/noise`.
An example configuration for producing one day of ET noise data is provided in :code:`ET_Triangle_EMR_noise_config.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    globals:
      working-directory: .
      simulator-arguments:
        sampling-frequency: 4096
        max-samples: 22
        duration: 4096
        start_time: 1577491218
      output-arguments: {}
      output-directory: ET_Triangle_EMR_noise
      metadata-directory: ET_Triangle_EMR_noise/metadata
    simulators:
      noise:
        class: ColoredNoise
        arguments:
          psd_file: ET_10_full_cryo_psd.txt
          detectors:
            - E1_Triangle_EMR
            - E2_Triangle_EMR
            - E3_Triangle_EMR
          seed: 0
        output:
          file_name: "E-{{ detector }}_STRAIN_NOISE-{{ start_time }}-{{ duration }}.gwf"
          arguments:
            channel: STRAIN

This configuration file creates 22 frame files per detector (E1, E2, E3 in the ET triangular setup).
Each file covers 4096 seconds, resulting in slightly more than 24 hours, beginning on 1 January 2030.

Frame files are saved in the :code:`./ET_Triangle_EMR_noise` folder, and metadata in :code:`./ET_Triangle_EMR_noise/metadata`.

Noise is simulated from the ``ET_10_full_cryo_psd`` sensitivity curve used in the `CoBA science study <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/07/068>`_ and available at ``LINK_TO_NOISE_CURVES_FOLDER``.
A low-frequency cutoff of 2 Hz is used.

.. note::
    Ensure that sufficient disk space is available before starting the dataset generating.
    Each GWF file is about 125 MB, so for the three detectors you will need approximately 8.5 GB for one day of noise files and metadata.

    The noise generation will take around `ADD_RUNTIME_ESTIMATE` on a CPU `ADD_STATISTICS`.
    For generating the dataset in batches or for resuming an interrupted run (e.g., due to system shutdown), see `SECTION W`.

To generate the ET noise data, run this command in your working directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $ gwsim simulate ET_Triangle_EMR_noise_config.yaml

----------------------
Generating CBC signals
----------------------

Signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) can be generated using configuration files located in :code:`gwsim/examples/CBC_signals`.
An example configuration for producing one day of ET data containing binary black hole (BBH) signals from a realistic population is provided in :code:`ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH_config.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    globals:
      working-directory: .
      simulator-arguments:
        sampling-frequency: 4096
        max-samples: 22
        duration: 4096
        start_time: 1577491218
      output-arguments: {}
      output-directory: ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH
      metadata-directory: ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH/metadata
    simulators:
      noise:
        class: CBCSimulator
        arguments:
          population_file: 18321_1yrCatalogBBH.h5
          waveform_model: IMRPhenomXPHM,
          waveform_arguments: {'earth_rotation': True, 'time_dependent_timedelay': True}
          minimum_frequency: 2,
          detectors:
            - E1_Triangle_EMR
            - E2_Triangle_EMR
            - E3_Triangle_EMR
        output:
          file_name: "E-{{ detector }}_STRAIN_BBH-{{ start_time }}-{{ duration }}.gwf"
          arguments:
            channel: STRAIN

As with the noise example, this configuration file produces 22 frame files per detectors, each lasting 4096 seconds, for a total of slightly more than 24 hours.
The dataset again begins on 1 January 1 2030.

Frame files are saved in the :code:`./ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH` folder, and metadata in :code:`./ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH/metadata`.

BBH signals are injected in zero noise from the ``18321_1yrCatalogBBH`` population file used in the CoBa study and ``publicly available <https://apps.et-gw.eu/tds/?content=3&r=18321>``_ .
The ``IMRPhenomXPHM <https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.104056>``_ waveform model is used, with a low-frequency cutoff of 2 Hz and including Earth rotation effects.

The configuration file to generate one day of ET data containing binary neutron stars (BNS) signals can be found at :code:`ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH_config.yaml`, with the following arguments:

- population_file: ``18321_1yrCatalogBNS``, used in the CoBa study and `publicly available <https://apps.et-gw.eu/tds/?content=3&r=18321>`_ .
- waveform_model: `IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2 <https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.100.044003>`_ , with a low-frequency cutoff of 2 Hz and including Earth rotation effects.

Files are saved in :code:`./ET_Triangle_EMR_BNS`, metadata in :code:`./ET_Triangle_EMR_BNS/metadata`.

.. note::
    Ensure that sufficient disk space is available before starting the dataset generating.
    Each GWF file is about `ADD_ESTIMATE`, so for the three detectors you will need around `ADD_ESTIMATE` total for one day of signal files and metadata, for each kind of source.

    The signals generation will take around `ADD_RUNTIME_ESTIMATE` on a CPU `ADD_STATISTICS` for each kind of source.
    For generating the dataset in batches or for resuming an interrupted run (e.g., due to system shutdown), see `SECTION W`.

To generate the ET signals data from CBCs, run this command in your working directory:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: BBH

      .. code-block:: console

          $ gwsim simulate ET_Triangle_EMR_BBH_config.yaml

   .. tab:: BNS

      .. code-block:: console

          $ gwsim simulate ET_Triangle_EMR_BNS_config.yaml

Using different detector configurations
---------------------------------------

Several ET detector configurations are provided as :code:`.interferometer` files at :code:`gwsim/detector/detectors`:

- Triangular configuration (Meuse–Rhine Euregion)

  - :code:`E1_Triangle_EMR`
  - :code:`E2_Triangle_EMR`
  - :code:`E3_Triangle_EMR`

- Triangular configuration (Sardinia)

  - :code:`E1_Triangle_Sardinia`
  - :code:`E2_Triangle_Sardinia`
  - :code:`E3_Triangle_Sardinia`

- 2L aligned configuration (Sardinia + Meuse–Rhine Euregion)

  - :code:`E1_2L_Aligned_Sardinia`
  - :code:`E2_2L_Aligned_EMR`

- 2L misaligned configuration (Sardinia + Meuse–Rhine Euregion)

  - :code:`E1_2L_Misaligned_Sardinia`
  - :code:`E2_2L_Misaligned_EMR`

The coordinates of the Meuse-Rhine Euregion and Sardinia locations follows from the CoBA study .

To use a specific detector configuration, update the detectors list in your YAML configuration file.
For example, to generate data for 2L aligned configuration of ET:

.. code-block:: yaml

      detectors:
        - E1_2L_Aligned_Sardinia
        - E2_2L_Aligned_EMR

Although not required, it is a good practice to keep different dataset in separate folders.
For this reason, it always recommendable to change the :code:`output-directory` and :code:`metadata-directory` arguments in your configuration file accordingly.

.. note::
    You do not need to include all detectors of a configuration.
    For example, to generate only E1 data:

    .. code-block:: yaml

          detectors:
            - E1_2L_Aligned_Sardinia

----------------------------------
Using different sensitivity curves
----------------------------------

Several ET sensitivity curves are available at :code:`gwsim/detector/noise_curves`, following the CoBa study.

As with the detector configuration, to use a specific detector sensitivity curve simply update the :code:`psd_file` entry in your YAML configuration file.
For example, to generate data for a 15 km arms interferometer without the xylophone configuration (high-frequency instrument only):

.. code-block:: yaml

      psd_file: ET_15_HF_psd.txt

Note that the detector geometries implemented in GWSim assume 10 km arms interferometers for the ET triangular configuration, and 15 km arms interferometers for the ET 2L configuration.
For consistency, choose the sensitivity curves accordingly.

----------------------------------
Using different signal populations
----------------------------------


-------------------------
Generating longer dataset
-------------------------

The duration of the generated dataset is controlled by three parameters in the configuration file:

- :code:`start_time`: GPS start time of the dataset
- :code:`duration`: duration (in seconds) of each frame file
- :code:`max-samples`: number of consecutive frame files

GWSim generates :code:`max-samples` files of length :code:`duration`, starting from :code:`start_time`.
To generate longer or shorter dataset, simply adjust these parameters.

In particular, the total duration of your dataset (in seconds) is:

.. code-block:: python

    total_duration = duration * max-samples

while the final GPS time end time:

.. code-block:: python

    end_time = start_time + (duration * max-samples)

It is also possible to change the sampling frequency of your data set (the number of samples per second, measured in Hz), using the :code:`sampling-frequency` argument.

.. note::
    Sampling frequencies are often chosen to be powers of 2 for computational efficiency.
    A common choice in GW data analysis is 4096 Hz.
    Lowering the sampling frequency reduce computation time but also reduce the highest resolvable frequency (which is half of the sampling frequency from the Nyquist theorem).
