Example configuration files
===========================

This section provides links to example configuration files that can be used for data generation with GWSim, as described in SECTION X.

All example configurations linked here generate 22 frame files per detector, each 4096 seconds long and sampled at 4096 Hz, resulting in slightly more than 24 hours of data starting from 1 January 2030.
Refer to ``SECTION X`` for instructions on modifying the dataset duration (e.g., one week, one month, ...) or other dataset properties (population file, detector sensitivity, etc.).

For a more complete and user-friendly guide to writing configuration files tailored to your needs, see SECTION Y.

1. Noise generation:

  - Uncorrelated noise for the triangular ET (EMR site)
  - Correlated noise for the triangular ET (EMR site)
  - Uncorrelated noise for the triangular ET (Sardinia site)
  - Correlated noise for the triangular ET (Sardinia site)

  - Uncorrelated noise for the 2L aligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)
  - Uncorrelated noise for the 2L misaligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)

2. CBC signals generation:

  - BBH signals for the triangular ET (EMR site)
  - BBH signals for the triangular ET (Sardinia site)
  - BNS signals for the triangular ET (EMR site)
  - BNS signals the triangular ET (Sardinia site)

  - BBH signals for the 2L aligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)
  - BBH signals for the 2L misaligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)
  - BNS signals for the 2L aligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)
  - BNS signals for the 2L misaligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)

3. Glitch generation:

  - Glitches for the triangular ET (EMR site)
  - Glitches for the triangular ET (Sardinia site)

  - Glitches for the 2L aligned ET (E1 located in Sardinia, E2 located in the EMR)
